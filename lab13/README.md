Lab 13 : User federation using LDAP
=============================================================

For this lab we are going to use Openldap as a user provider.

From the current directory of this lab, execute the following docker command to spin up a ready-to-use LDAP server :

```bash
docker run --env LDAP_ORGANISATION="The Corporation" --env LDAP_DOMAIN="corp.com" --env LDAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<OPENLDAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD> --volume ./data/:/home/data/ -p 389:389 -p 636:636 --name openldap osixia/openldap:1.3.0
```

The project uses a sample [user database](./ldap/conf/ldap_data.ldif) that can be imported as follows:

```bash
docker exec openldap ldapadd -x -H ldap://localhost -D "cn=admin,dc=corp,dc=com" -w <OPENLDAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD> -f /home/data/ldap_data.ldif
``` 
LDAP view:

## Directory Server Integration

Let's now configure an existing realm to use our new LDAP server. This can be done via `User Federation` menu of Keycloak in left hand side then using `Add    Provider --> ldap`. A sample configuration is as follows:

![addldap1](./images/add_ldap_1.jpg)

![addldap2](./images/add_ldap_2.jpg)

The sample configuration enables Keycloak to use OpenLDAP server as user base with a designated synchronization policy defined under `Sync Settings`. In order to perform a force synchronization `Synchronize all users` button under that page should be used. As sample LDAP user entities contains title and photo attributes LDAP mappers with the type of `user-attribute-ldap-mapper` should be set in Keycloak. The `Mappers` tab under the same page:

![addldap3](./images/add_ldap_3.jpg)

![addldap4](./images/add_ldap_4.jpg)

These mappings should also done for client created in order to retrieve these user attributes via `/userinfo` endpoint. This can be done under `Mappers` tab using `Create` button on relevant client definition page:  
![userinfo1](./images/userinfo_1.jpg)

![userinfo2](./images/userinfo_2.jpg)

## Roles

Roles and scopes are used to classify and control access to resources. Roles and scopes can be used by resource server to decide whether request to access a resource (API call) is authorized. For this project we only use LDAP based roles not scopes for authorization.

In order to use LDAP as a base for role definitions a new LDAP mapper with the type of `role-ldap-mapper` should be added under defined User Federation setting of LDAP. A sample configuration applies to our pre-defined user database is as follows:

![addldaproles](./images/add_ldap_roles.jpg)

Clicking ``Sync LDAP Roles To Keycloak` adds LDAP group names as roles to Realm level role list per the sample configuration above and LDAP based user-role assignments take place:

![addroles](./images/add_roles.jpg)

![userrole1](./images/user_role_1.jpg)

![userrole2](./images/user_role_2.jpg)
